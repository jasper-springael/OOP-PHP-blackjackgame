Sprints:

  day1:

  Struggled with the correct usage of $_SESSION and $_POST.
  Base logic and class building were done but needed improvement.

  day 2:

  After a golden tip about $_SESSION, I finally had basic functionality.
  I also rebuilt the classes with a constructor and improved my existing logic.



  End thoughts:

  A lot of frustration and impostor feelings on day 1 but day 2 was a good day.
  Will have another look at PHP globals to understand the concept better.
